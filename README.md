# Introduction
CAREN is a simulation game of a battle between viruses and antibodies in your body. Both have their unique genetic codes which determine their behavior. 
Genetic codes are written using a specified grammar as per stated in the project specification.
The game must be run on a web page with a Java back-end which handles all the non-visual computation of the game.

## The Grammar

The grammar for our genetic codes are based on this image, but we modified it to fit the real-time + no grid nature of our game. The modifications can be found in the design document.
